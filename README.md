# Wedding Invite Website

This repository contains a minimal static website for a wedding invitation.

Getting started

- Initialize git, commit, and push to a new GitHub repository.
- Enable GitHub Pages in the repository Settings (source: `main` branch / root) or deploy via GitHub Actions.

Quick commands (replace `yourusername/repo` with your repo):

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial wedding site"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/repo.git
git push -u origin main
```

If you'd like, I can add a GitHub Actions workflow to auto-deploy to `gh-pages` on push.
